To create a REST API for the frontend to interact with the backend in React, you can follow these steps:

    1. Fetch the data from the API: Use the fetch() method or a library like Axios to make a GET request to the API endpoint and retrieve the data.

    2. Store the data in the state: Store the data in the React state to make it accessible to other components.

    3. Display the data in the frontend: Use the data from the state to display the stories and their respective story points in the UI.

    4. Handle user input: When a user selects a story or assigns a story point, send a PUT request to the API endpoint to update the data on the backend.

    5. Update the frontend: Update the state with the latest data after the API call is complete, so that the UI reflects the changes made by the user.

Here is a code sample for making a GET request to retrieve the stories and their story points from the API:
